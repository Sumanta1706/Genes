The 14 locations shown in the following sequence of ribozyme is the input feature in order to find the fitness of the HDV ribozyme:  GGACCATTCGAMTCCCATTAGRCTGGKCCGCCTCCTSGCGGCGGGAGTTGSGCKAGGGAGGAASAGYCTTYYCTAGRCTAASGMSCATCGATCCGGTTCGCCGGATCCAAATCGGGCTTCGGTCCGGTTC The fitness value is a number between Zero and One. The fitness value example: 0.020744. The input example: AATCGGCCTCACAG. The input values are from the set {A, C, T, and G}. The model building is about building a function that takes the data about Genotype and maps it to the fitness of the HDV ribozyme.
